    <h2>About Warabi Mochi</h2>
    <p>Warabi Mochi is made out of warabi (bracken) starch. It's texture is more jelly-like unlike the typical mochi
        made from glutinous rice. It has almost no flavor except for the sweet toasted soybear flour (kinako) added as a
        topping.
    <h3>Ingredients></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup Warabi Mochiko or Warabiko (bracken starch)</li>
        <li>½ cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ cup kinako (roasted soybean flour)</li>
        <li>kuromitsu (brown sugar syrup)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare all ingredients and sprinkle some kinako on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the Warabi Mochiko, sugar, and water and mix all together.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the mixture over medium heat until it starts to boil.</li>
        <li>Then reduce the heat. Using a wooden spatula, stir (more like beat) constantly and vigorously for 10 minutes, or until the mixture is thick and evenly translucent. It’s quite a workout but be patient, it’ll transform to clear color!</li>
        <li>Remove the mochi from the heat and transfer to a baking sheet that’s covered with kinako (soybean flour). Sprinkle more kinako on top and let it cool in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once it’s cooled, take it out from the refrigerator and slice into ¾ inch cubes. Toss the warabi mochi with kinako and serve on the plate. If you like, pour the Kuromitsu (brown sugar syrup) over the Warabi mochi and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
